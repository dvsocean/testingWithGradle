#Feature: Create a node
#  Scenario: Node creation providing multiple params
#    Given I hit the correct endpoint
#    When I provide "TechJunkie" as the node name
#    And I make sure station size is not empty
#    And Im able to find "TechJunkie" in the garage
#    Then the created node should exist in the station
